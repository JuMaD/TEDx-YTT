# Contributing to TEDx-YTT
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it is:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Our development process
We use GitHub to sync code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've changed APIs (in our case: parameteres that are parsed through config- and arg-parser), update the documentation.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); 

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary 
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
- log.log file and date & time of the occurence of the issue (if you turned logging on)


## Use a Consistent Coding Style
- We aim to be as PEP-8 consistent as possible. Please check your code before submitting.
- Please use docstrings to document your functions and objects. If you add parameters or returns adjust existing docstrings!
